## The Application

This application was developed as an assigment for the Monash Full Stack Bootcamp. It is a simple weather dashboard that offers the user the otion to search for cities and displays the weather forecast for the next 7 days. It uses the [OpenWeather One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) to retrieve weather data for cities and uses `localStorage` to store any persistent data.

## User Story

The application was based in the following user story:

```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

## Acceptance Criteria

The application has the the following acceptance criteria:

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
